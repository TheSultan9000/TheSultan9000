### My background

<p> 
    
    👨‍🎓 I completed my BSc in Biomedical science (Brunel university London), 
       my MSc in Immunology (Imperial College London) and my PhD in Regenerative medicine (King's College London)

    🧑‍🏫 During my studies I had the oppertunity to work with statisticians which ignited my passion for data science

    🖥️ Since completing my PhD I have made it my mission to learn as much as possible in the way of programming
       languages to help my progression in data science
